# Introduction

SamRewritten is an open-source program that allows you to unlock and relock your Steam achievements. It is named after the famous Steam Achievement Manager written by Gibbed, and aims to implement its functionalities on Linux, and more!

It comes with third-party tools integration and a nice user interface.

SamRewritten is constantly under development, if you think you can give us a hand, feel free to reach us :)

# Building

To build this project, clone this repository on your PC, and run the `make` command within the repository folder that you downloaded.

Alternatively, you can download one of our releases in the AppImage format. Check the 'Release' tab of this repository to find them.
To build your own AppImage, build SamRewritten normally, then execute `build_appimage.sh` in the `package` folder, it will take care of everything for you.

For Arch users, there is also a PKGBUILD within the `package` folder if you wish to build it using `makepkg`.

If you're encountering issues building SamRewritten, make sure you have installed the required packages on your machine. You'll most likely need Steam, curl, yajl, GTK 3, and GLib.

* Ubuntu (and variants): `$ sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libyajl-dev`

* Arch (and variants): `$ sudo pacman -S gtk3 glibc gnutls yajl`

* openSUSE Thumbleweed: `$ sudo zypper install gtk3-devel gcc-c++ gnutls libcurl-devel libyajl-devel-static`

To run SamRewritten, simply launch `$ ./bin/launch.sh`

# AUR Installation

You can install SamRewritten from the AUR by installing the `samrewritten-git` package.

Run SamRewritten by opening the corresponding desktop entry, or by using the `samrewritten` command.

# Command line options

I know you linux geeks love to use command line options.
We have big ambitions for SamRewritten, and I believe many of them are related to these command-line options, so stay put, because that list will be growing soon!

* -a \<appid\>
	* Prevents the window from showing and sets your status to "In Game"
	* `./bin/launch.sh -a 10` will idle Counter Strike

## Third-party apps integration

SamRewritten uses JSON to communicate between the interface and the "backend logic". Communications are transmitted via unix sockets. If you plan to make an app using some of SamRewritten's features, feel free to ask for help, for features, or to contribute.
